Installation Instructions
=========================

The easiest way to install mortar_workflow is::

  easy_install mortar_workflow

Or, if you're using `zc.buildout`, just specify ``mortar_workflow`` as a
required egg. 

If you're developing a package or application that relies on mortar_workflow,
then add it as a dependency in your package's :file:`setup.py`, for example::

  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  setup(
     # ...
    install_requires = [
        'mortar_workflow',
       ])

.. note:: 

  This package requires Python 2.6 or newer, but does not work Python
  3 or above.
